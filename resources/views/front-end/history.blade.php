                As far back as the seventeenth century instruments for the extraction and scaling of teeth had been
                included in military surgeons’ chests, but there were to be no uniformed dentists in the Army until
                after the start of the First World War. The Army deployed to France in 1914 without any dental officers,
                however, within two months of General Haigh suffering toothache during the first battle of the Aisne in
                September 1914, six dental officers had been commissioned and sent to France. By the end of the year
                twenty dental officers were serving in France and by the end of the war 892 Army dental officers were
                looking after the needs of both the Army and the newly formed RAF.

                On 4th January 1921, King George V signed the Royal Warrant authorising the formation of The Army Dental
                Corps (AD Corps).
                Demobilisation saw most dental officers return to civilian practice. Their need in the Army, however,
                had been established. In 1919 The British Dental Association lobbied the War Office for the formation of
                a Dental Corps and proposed the structure for such a Corps. This was accepted by the War Office and the
                Treasury. In February 1920, the Secretary of State for War, Winston Churchill, presented the Army
                estimates for 1920/21 to Parliament, including the intention to form an Army Dental Corps.

                On 4th January 1921, King George V signed the Royal Warrant authorising the formation of The Army Dental
                Corps (AD Corps).

                Through the provision of dental treatment and education in oral hygiene the dental condition of the Army
                began to show marked improvement. The first operational deployments for members of the Corps came
                immediately in the form of the 1921-24 Waziristan Campaign in the Indian North-West Frontier Province
                followed in 1927 with the deployment of dental teams as part of the Shanghai Defence Force. 1928 saw the
                first dental officer commissioned into the TA and in 1930 the responsibility for the RAF ceased with the
                formation of the RAF Dental Branch and the transfer of a number of personnel to the RAF in order to form
                the nucleus of the new Branch.

                In recognition for its services during the war, in 1946, the Corps was granted the Regimental Honour of
                ROYAL from which time it became the Royal Army Dental Corps (RADC).
                By 1939 the AD Corps had almost doubled in size with dental centres in garrisons across the UK and
                overseas as well as teams in military hospitals and field medical units. The Second World War was to see
                an over ten-fold increase in the Corps’ size, at its height rising to 2143 dental officers, 3833
                soldiers and 267 Auxiliary Territorial Service as dental clerk-orderlies in the Home Commands. The
                dental officer strength represented one in every seven dentists registered in the UK at the time.

                Whilst the major effort was in treating the vast number of new recruits, personnel were also deployed
                overseas to garrison dental centres as well as in large numbers to field ambulances, casualty clearing
                stations, hospitals, field dental centres, field dental laboratories and mobile dental units. A number
                of personnel were killed or wounded in action and others were taken prisoner of war. Two dental officers
                ended up in Colditz and Pte Coe, a dental mechanic, successfully escaped from a Camp in Poland to become
                the first British Prisoner of War to escape from a WW2 PoW Camp and complete the ‘home run’ back to the
                UK. He was awarded the DCM at a private audience with the King. Four dental officers won the Military
                Cross for their actions during the invasion of Sicily; the beach landings on D-Day; crossing the Rhine
                on Operation PLUNDER; and in the battle of Kohima.

                In recognition for its services during the war, in 1946, the Corps was granted the Regimental Honour of
                ROYAL from which time it became the Royal Army Dental Corps (RADC).

                In 1948, with the advent of the NHS, the Corps’ role was expanded to include dental care to military
                families and other entitled civilians stationed overseas. During the Cold War, with the Army’s focus on
                NW Europe, a large proportion of the Corps was to be stationed in Germany for the next 60 years. Outside
                NW Europe the last 70+ years has seen the RADC deployed in support of the Army on a wide variety of
                operations including Palestine, the Malayan Emergency, Korean War, Mau Mau Uprising, Cyprus, Suez
                Crisis, Brunei Revolt, Borneo confrontation, Aden, Northern Ireland, Falklands War.

                Whilst the fall of the Berlin wall signalled the end of the Cold War, conflicts elsewhere in the world
                soon saw the RADC deployed in other Theatres.

                Whilst the fall of the Berlin wall signalled the end of the Cold War, conflicts elsewhere in the world
                soon saw the RADC deployed in other Theatres in support of the Army in the First Gulf War, Iraq and
                Afghanistan as well as in peacekeeping operations in Angola, the Balkans and South Sudan and on
                humanitarian aid deployments such as the Ebola outbreak in Sierra Leone.

                Recent events have also seen them involved with the military and NHS response to the Covid-19 crisis.
                In 1996 the Headquarters of the three Service Dental Branches combined to form the Defence Dental Agency
                (DDA). In the early 2000s the DDA was changed to the Defence Dental Services under the Surgeon General
                and after further restructuring now forms the dental element of Defence Primary Healthcare (DPHC(D)).
                Throughout these changes the RADC and its RN and RAF colleagues have retained their single Service
                identities whilst benefitting from efficiencies in combined training, policy making and resourcing. RADC
                personnel not only continue to serve in the Firm Base as part of DPHC(D) but also in Medical Regiments
                of the Field Army where they occupy both clinical and command/staff appointments.

                Recent events have also seen them involved with the military and NHS response to the Covid-19 crisis,
                providing emergency care for Ukrainian soldiers training in the UK and in ceremonial duties as part of
                the King’s Coronation.
