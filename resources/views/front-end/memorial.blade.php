                Following the Second World War, a Memorial Stone was commissioned by the Corps to commemorate the
                officers and men of the Royal Army Dental Corps who gave their lives during that war. On Monday 16th
                August 1948, a Memorial Service was conducted at the Depot and Training Establishment RADC, Connaught
                Road by the Chaplain General, the Rev Canon FL Hughes, BBE, MC, MA TD, Chaplain to the King.

                At the Service the Memorial Stone and a Book of Remembrance were unveiled by the Adjutant-General,
                General Sir James S Steele KBE, CB, DSO, MC, LLD. Wreaths were laid by General Sir James S Steele, Major
                General JCA Dowse (representing Director General Army Medical Services), Major General AB Austin
                (Director Army Dental Service), and Colonel JP Duguid (Colonel Commandant RADC). The music was provided
                by the Band and Buglers of the RAMC, and the ceremony was attended by over 500 personnel.

                The Memorial Stone, a plinth of Cornish granite, was originally sited in front of the main entrance to
                the Depot and Training Establishment RADC in the old Connaught Hospital building.

                Above the inscription the former badge of the Army Dental Corps is mounted in gold, and on the reverse
                of the plinth the new badge is mounted with the words: ''Royal Army Dental Corps" signifying the change
                in the title of the Corps in 1946.

                When the Depot and Training Establishment RADC moved into its new, purpose built, accommodation on
                Evelyn Woods Road, the Memorial Stone was relocated to stand in front of the main entrance of the new
                building on 27th September 1973.

                Following reductions in the size of the Corps in line with the general downsizing of the Armed Forces in
                the 1990s and early 2000s Aldershot no longer held the centre of gravity of the Corps.

                This along with the redevelopment of Aldershot Garrison was likely to leave the Memorial’s location as
                no longer ‘fit for purpose’ as it would be left as largely unseen and unrecognised.

                The decision, therefore, was taken to relocate the Memorial Stone to the National Memorial Arboretum
                (NMA) at Arlewas in Staffordshire where it would not only be more centrally placed for access from
                across the UK but also significantly increase its public profile as the NMA attracts over 300,000
                visitors a year.

                To mark the Corps Centenary Year in 1921, the memorial and surrounding paving was refurbished, the small
                plaque at the base of the plinth was removed and replaced with a new Centenary Stone adjacent to the
                Memorial. On 8 September 2021 the Memorial was re-dedicated and HRH The Duchess of Gloucester GCVO the
                Colonel-in-Chief RADC unveiled the new Centenary Stone. The new stone is inscribed with the AD Corps and
                RADC badges in colour.
