                    On Friday 15 November 2024, officers and soldiers paraded officially
                    for
                    the last time as members of the Royal Army Dental Corps (RADC). They did so proudly, with colleagues
                    from the Royal Army Medical Corps (RAMC) and Queen Alexandra's Royal Army Nursing Corps(QARANC),
                    alongside whom they serve together on operations.

                    The news that our Corps was to amalgamate was announced at relatively
                    short notice in the
                    Autumn of 2024 and must, therefore, have come as a bit of a surprise. We fully recognise
                    that
                    some of you will have felt that you had been kept in the dark. I am truly sorry for this but, in
                    actual
                    fact, we were prevented from breaking the news, and involving you in the discussions, by a series of
                    events: the death of our Late Queen; the coronation; the announcement and then the conduct of the
                    general election; and, finally, the desire of the new government to announce it in its own way. The
                    King
                    had already been consulted, had asked some good questions and then assented in the Spring, but we
                    were
                    ordered not to break cover because public bodies went into election purdah. I would wish to
                    emphasise
                    that this was never a takeover bid by the bigger Corps, and not another Defence cut - our dental
                    representatives were fully involved.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    All of my fellow Trustees want to hear from you and to answer your
                    questions, but also in case there are vitally important aspects which we may have missed and can
                    put
                    right.

                    This
                    brings me to the stance which I hope our veterans will adopt. It
                    is
                    perfectly possible to support fully the new Service and yet still be proud of our shared heritage.
                    The
                    two positions are not mutually exclusive - I am genuinely excited about our new Service, while still
                    retaining pride in and a deep fondness for the RADC.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    We have all heard stories about other amalgamations of the past, in
                    which
                    members of former regiments remained at daggers-drawn, refusing to engage with the other parties,
                    until
                    eventually they became irrelevant and faded away altogether. Such behaviour would only serve to
                    confuse
                    and hinder the serving soldiers who must carry Army dentistry into the future.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    The Trustees of the RADC Association have chosen, instead, to show
                    leadership, fully backing the new Service, and our serving dental personnel of the present and the
                    future. So, instead of bitterness, let us create a thriving and supportive community of old
                    comrades,
                    fully in-step with the RAMS.
                </flux:text>

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    The new Service is recognisably 'medical', but with many elements of
                    which
                    we should be proud. I was fortunate to contribute to the Heritage Working Group, along with our
                    current
                    Corps Sergeant Major, WOI (RSM) Zoe Beckett, to whom I pay tribute as having fought very hard to
                    protect
                    RADC regalia. I adopted some personal rules of thumb: that we were forging a new medical identity;
                    that
                    no-one could turn up on Day 2 without having made some concessions and also having adopted items
                    from
                    the other Corps; that we should all be allowed to bring to the table items of our own Corps identity
                    which made us distinctive. Lastly, we should not necessarily incorporate every single desired item
                    from
                    all three Corps - we mustn't look like circus ring masters, and the overall effect should be
                    powerful,
                    but dignified.
                </flux:text>

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    We have tried to forge a distinctive identity; one of which we can
                    all be
                    proud. The new capbadge is a blend of motifs from the three Corps. It had to be clearly, visibly
                    medical. In the RADC, we were/are particularly proud of our dragon, but several preparatory
                    sketches
                    showed that retaining it, at all costs, led to designs which were entertaining, but not suitably
                    dignified for a new corps of the British Army. Instead, we contributed the sword, which was
                    combined
                    with the QARANC Dannebrog Cross to form the sword's hilt. I suggested that the Junior Ranks'
                    metal badge
                    might be bronzed, to be emblematic of the 28 Victoria Crosses won by the medical service of the
                    Crown.
                    The motto is a new one, in English for clarity: <strong>STEADFAST</strong>, which reminds us to
                    be
                    utterly reliable, even
                    in adversity, and which perfectly commemorates our beloved Late Queen.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    In the modern age, working dress (some of us will know this as
                    'combats')
                    is the norm, so this was the uniform in which I wanted to have the most impact, so that we would
                    always
                    have a reminder of the RADC.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    We have adopted a grey beret, carried forward from QARANC. I
                    fought long,
                    hard and successfully to have a green backing to the beret badge. So that, whilst our sword may
                    be
                    difficult to see from 10 yards, the observer will always see some green. In the field, the
                    uniform item
                    which indicates one's Arm or Service is the Tactical Recognition Flash (TRF), worn on the right
                    sleeve.
                    We have adopted key colours from the three Corps: Medical sombre red, drawn from the VC ribbon;
                    Dental
                    green, now to be Victoria Green (after the project title); and QARANC grey. Green is absolutely
                    central
                    to the design. This is also mirrored in the new stable belt. Mess kit will have dark red
                    facings, but a
                    dental green waistcoat or, with the dress, waist sash. The realities of funding, however, may
                    see old
                    mess kits continue until they time-out.

                    One nice
                    touch is that all ranks below the rank of Colonel will have the
                    privilege of wearing a ribbon of the French First World War Croix de Guerre on their left
                    shoulder. This
                    distinction is a commemorative gift from the French Republic, bestowed originally on 24
                    Field Ambulance
                    for its efforts in saving the citizens of St. Amand-Les-Eaux, which had been bombarded by
                    the enemy in
                    1918.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    The title for the new Service caused informed commentators to ask
                    why we
                    weren't simply to be the Royal Army Medical Corps, but that goes back to my rule of thumb, that
                    no side
                    should be able to continue without having made some changes. The King gave his approval to the
                    word
                    'Service', and it neatly reflects exactly our role.
                </flux:text>

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    I was emphatic that, in our quest for a fresh identity, we must
                    not throw
                    the baby out with the bath water. We are a medical Service and, therefore, our facing colour and
                    piping
                    could/should be roughly a blood colour. Similarly, I recommended that the Service's quick march
                    should
                    continue to be the RAMC's 'Here's a Health Unto His Majesty'. Why? Because, it has a steady
                    beat, and is
                    very easy to march to for soldiers on parade. Certainly, our old march 'Green Facings' was
                    unique, but
                    never quite so straightforward to keep in step to.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    The associations and veteran groupings of all three Corps are now
                    feeling
                    their way forward. As you know, our RADC Association is our charity, and our charity is our
                    association.
                    Looking ahead, 'the Association' will run out out of new members and will eventually fade away
                    so, as
                    you know, our Trustees are recommending that we consider dissolving the charity, to transfer our
                    funds
                    to the new RAMS charity. We will have dental representation on the Board of the charity, so we
                    can be
                    confident that dental activities and benevolence will continue.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    Dissolving 'The' Association would mean that there would
                    potentially be a
                    comradeship gap, so it now looks as if there will be friendly, localised groupings of a RADC old
                    comrades' association. As Trustees, and with ample experience of having to herd cats, we would
                    suggest
                    that these local groups might sensibly remain semi-formal, thus minimising the requirement to
                    hold and
                    account for funds, with all the necessary governance which that would entail. Such groups, and I
                    would
                    include here the RADC marching contingent at the cenotaph, could reasonably bid for limited
                    funds to
                    support specific projects and events.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    Projecting forwards 50 years, very few of us proud Late/RADC folk
                    will
                    still be alive, so I anticipate that dental remembrance will ultimately all be carried out
                    through the
                    RAMS Association. So how do we get from where we are to where we need to be?
                </flux:text>

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    A few decades ago, one insightful Military Secretary introduced a
                    guiding
                    principle: that the needs of the Service come first, but only very slightly ahead of the needs
                    of the
                    individual. This is not a cast iron rule, so it can be adjusted as circumstances require. We can
                    forge a
                    similar principle: that we rally round and support the serving dental personnel first and
                    foremost, but
                    that our veterans come a close second. Clearly, in terms of remembrance and benevolence, those
                    would be
                    the very occasions when our attention would rightly be on the past. Our shared dental heritage,
                    in the
                    service of the Army and our patients, is what uniquely binds us and is the link between the
                    past, the
                    present and the future.

                    To that
                    end, we must protect our book of remembrance. The RAMC is
                    fortunate to lodge its book in Westminster Abbey. It may be that the RAMS will be privileged
                    to maintain
                    its book there too and, of course, future dental personal will be recorded in it. However,
                    our book of
                    remembrance is every bit as important as those of the other two Corps. I strongly believe
                    that the Corps
                    Chapel and the RADC Turning of the Page must be maintained and fostered.

                <flux:text class="leading-relaxed">
                    Initially, one suspects that the associations of the three Corps
                    will make
                    a point of being separate from one another. However, by their very nature, they cannot go on
                    forever and
                    they will progressively shrink. I can envisage, and would support, a time in the near future, in
                    which
                    we gather together, RAMS in the lead, but proudly followed closely by groupings of the RAMC,
                    RADC and
                    QARANC Associations. Carrying that image further, I can actually envisage one 'squad' of the
                    same
                    ingredients. Personally, I will be proud of my roots, but also proud of the new Service and, if
                    invited,
                    proud to stand alongside my ex-RAMC and ex-QARANC friends and colleagues.

                    I would encourage us to go 'all in' by identifying with our
                    serving
                    colleagues, backing them, supporting and encouraging them, while still remaining loyal to the
                    memory of
                    our old Corps. We can use the past to inspire, and here I'm thinking of our origins, of Private
                    Coe DCM,
                    of Donald Taylor, of dentistry attempted in captivity, of Captain Ridler MC in Sicily and then
                    at
                    Arnhem, and so forth. We can contribute a lot to the new Service by education, describing how we
                    met the
                    challenges of the past, adapting kit and techniques for the operational setting, and by showing
                    friendship.
